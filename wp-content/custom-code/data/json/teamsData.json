The team focuses not only on technical bioinformatics tasks, such as primary data analysis using nf-core and project-specific downstream analysis and visualization for publications, but also on the administrative and logistical coordination of complex, often interdisciplinary projects. This includes scientific project management activities such as consulting, experimental design, coordination with external data-generating partners, business reporting, user access management, and cost estimation. In addition, the team plays a key role in research data management (RDM), ensuring that raw data and curated metadata are collected in accordance with FAIR principles. Overall, the BioPM team operates at the intersection of scientific and operational aspects of core facility projects.",
